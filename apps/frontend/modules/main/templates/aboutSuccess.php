            <span class="heading1">Who are we? </span><br/><br/>
            <p>
            We are a group of sport enthusiasts who enjoy watching sport, both live or on television.     
            </p>
            <p>
            For us, watching a game is time to put aside from our everyday hassle while cheering for our favorite team or just enjoying quality competition. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In our day to day life we do not always remember or plan ahead for these occasions and we end up missing exciting competitions during the year.
            </p>
            <p>
            sportYcal is a tool we developed to help you, the sport fan, keep better track of your favorite sport teams and tournaments.
